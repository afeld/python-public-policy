# Resources

There are countless blog posts, videos, books, etc. out there. There is no "best" resource, as individuals prefer different formats, come in with different experience, and learn at different speeds. Anything that comes up near the top of a Google search will likely be fine.

## Learning more

Want to keep going with Python after this class? See [Developer Roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/) for directions you can go. This course doesn't spend a lot of time on [Python fundamentals](#python-fundamentals), so it's recommended that you do that first.

Many "learn Python" resources will be web development-oriented â€” they will probably mention [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)/[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/). If you want to stay focused on data, you might want to look for ones that focus on [data science](#data-analysisscience) or [Python 3 generally](#python-fundamentals). See [Courses](#courses).

## Jupyter outside this course

We use [a cloud-based Jupyter environment (JupyterHub)](lecture_0.ipynb#jupyter) for this course to avoid installation issues across student computers. This is the only environment that's supported for course work.

After this class, however, you'll no longer have access. To download the files:

1. Open a notebook
1. In a code cell, run `!tar -czvf ~/python_files.tar.gz ~`
1. From [the file browser](https://padmgp-4506-fall.rcnyu.org), check the box next to `python_files.tar.gz`, then click `Download`
1. On your computer, unzip the file.
   - On Windows, you may need to install [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to do so.

A non-exhaustive list of alternatives:

### Local

- [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)

### Cloud-based

- [Anaconda Notebooks](https://www.anaconda.com/products/notebooks)
- [Google Cloud Vertex AI Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-notebooks)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [Kaggle notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code)
- [Mode Notebooks](https://mode.com/help/articles/notebook)

### Matching the class environment

_Advanced_

Note these instructions won't work in Colab.

1. Install [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) [the repository](https://github.com/afeld/python-public-policy/tree/nyu).
1. Check out the `nyu` branch.
1. [Create the environment.](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) From this directory, run:

   ```sh
   mamba env create --file extras/environment.yml
   ```

1. Activate the environment:

   ```sh
   conda activate python-public-policy
   ```

1. Start the Jupyter server:

   ```sh
   make notebook
   ```
