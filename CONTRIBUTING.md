## Slides

While the lecture notes can be viewed as a plain notebook, they are also visible as slides. Viewing using [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/) is recommended.

## Notebook cleanup

To ensure that notebooks have the correct execution order and output, run them non-interactively.

```sh
./.github/workflows/update.sh <file>.ipynb
```
