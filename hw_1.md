# Homework 1

[General assignment information.](assignments.md) Note that this isn't a template notebook, hence there's no ðŸš€ above. You will create a blank notebook for this one.

## Tutorials

- [10 minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html)

## Coding

You'll complete this assignment using pandas. Steps:

1. [Find a dataset.](assignments/open_ended.md#open-data-portals)
   - It must have:
     - At least one numeric column
     - Between one thousand and one million rows
       - If it's larger than that, you can [make it smaller](assignments/open_ended.md#reducing-data-size).
   - Don't spend too long on this step.
1. If there's more than one numeric column, pick one.
1. Create a new notebook.
1. Read in the data.
1. Compute:
   - The mean
   - The median
   - The mode
1. Do a `groupby()` with an [aggregation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/groupby.html#aggregation).

Now [turn in the assignment](assignments.md).

## Tutorials, continued

1. Read [The Joys (and Woes) of the Craft of Software Engineering](https://cs.calvin.edu/courses/cs/262/kvlinden/references/brooksJoysAndWoes.html)
   - Note not _everything_ in there is applicable to data analysis
1. Filtering/indexing `DataFrame`s
   - [Filter specific rows from a `DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/03_subset_data.html#how-do-i-filter-specific-rows-from-a-dataframe)
   - [Boolean indexing](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing)
1. Learn about functions
   - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Os0o3wzS_I&list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7&index=8)
   - [Blog post](https://python.land/introduction-to-python/functions)
1. Coding Style Guides - Please skim these; I don't expect you to understand and follow everything in them. The most important guidelines to pay attention to are indentation and keeping each statement on its own line.
   - [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/)
   - [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
1. [Guide to commenting your code](https://realpython.com/python-comments-guide/)
1. [Quartz Guide to Bad Data](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide#readme)

### Optional

- [Learn about data dictionaries](https://analystanswers.com/what-is-a-data-dictionary-a-simple-thorough-overview/)
- Glance through pandas' [comparison with other tools](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/comparison/index.html) for any you are familiar with
- More on indexing:
  - [How to Select Rows from Pandas DataFrame](https://datatofish.com/select-rows-pandas-dataframe/)
  - Selecting Subsets of Data in Pandas: [Part 1](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-6fcd0170be9c) and [Part 2](https://medium.com/dunder-data/selecting-subsets-of-data-in-pandas-39e811c81a0c)
