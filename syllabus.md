## Description

This seven-week course exposes the students to the application and use of Python for data analytics in public policy setting. The course teaches introductory technical programming skills that allow students to learn Python and apply code on pertinent public policy data. The majority of the class content will utilize the [New York City 311 Service Requests](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) dataset. It's a rich dataset that can be explored from many angles relevant to real-world public policy and program management responsibilities.

Class will be split between:

- Lecture
- Demonstration
- Hands-on time to:
  - Play with the code from lectures
  - Start on the homework
  - Ask questions

## Homework

Homework assignments will consist of two different formats:

1. **Online tutorials:** In advance of classes, online tutorials will be assigned as homework. These online tutorials will introduce students to critical Python concepts. The following lecture will then focus on applying those concepts to real public policy data questions.
1. **Coding:** Students will complete Python coding exercises that apply new concepts they have learned in lecture. Coding assignments will build off of concepts covered in previous assignments.

These are expected to take 5-10 hours per week.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will know:

- Python fundamentals
  - Common data types
  - Functions
  - Reading technical documentation
  - Troubleshooting
- How to use [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and other packages for data exploration, manipulation, visualization, and analysis
- How to use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) as a coding environment
- How to work with open data
- How these tools and skills can be leveraged in a policy context

The overall grade is curved; see [the methodology](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/curve.html).


### Assignment scoring

- **Late work:** -10% per day
- **Syntax errors:** -10 points
- **Incomplete Steps / Steps with logic errors:** -2 to -5 points
- [**Visualizations incomplete, e.g. missing meaningful title/labels:**](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/lecture_3.html#chart-hygiene) -3 points
- **Unattempted Steps:** -10 points

If the submission showed effort, feedback will be given through comments in the notebook.

#### [Final Project](final_project.md)

The Final Project score will be the [median](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.median) of [peer grades](final_project/peer_grading.md). For the Final Project peer review score, the following apply per review:

- **Minimal feedback:** -10 points
- **Not reviewed:** -20 points



#### Extensions

Requests for extensions will only be considered if made via email before the deadline, up to [the late submission cutoff shown above](#schedule). Late submission deadlines will only be extended if there is accomodation requested through the school.

### Participation

To encourage cosnsistent, deeper thought about the Assignments, relevance to the broader world, etc., students are expected to do Between-Class Participation. This includes:

- Asking a question of substance
- Answering a question
- Posting a useful/interesting resource
- Sharing an insight

in either:

- Office hours
- [Ed Discussions](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/210776/external_tools/37606?display=borderless)
  - When starting a new Conversation, please use a descriptive Title to make them easier to navigate
  - Suggest checking your [notifications settings](https://edstem.org/us/settings/notifications) to make sure you see conversations that come through
- Email

A student's overall Between-Class Participation score is calculated based on some form of participation every week. The following don't count:

- In-class participation, due to:
  - The difficuly of tracking participation live
  - Some students being more shy
- Homework revisions
- Communications about grades or other administrivia

### Letter Grades

Letter grades for the entire course will be assigned as follows:

| Letter Grade | GPA Points | Description | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A            | 4.0 points | Excellent   | Exceptional work for a graduate student. Work at this level is unusually thorough, well-reasoned, creative, methodologically sophisticated, and well written. Work is of exceptional, professional quality.                                                                                                                                                                |
| A-           | 3.7 points | Very good   | Very strong work for a graduate student. Work at this level shows signs of creativity, is thorough and well-reasoned, indicates strong understanding of appropriate methodological or analytical approaches, and meets professional standards.                                                                                                                             |
| B+           | 3.3 points | Good        | Sound work for a graduate student; well-reasoned and thorough, methodologically sound. This is the graduate student grade that indicates the student has fully accomplished the basic objectives of the course.                                                                                                                                                            |
| B            | 3.0 points | Adequate    | Competent work for a graduate student even though some weaknesses are evident. Demonstrates competency in the key course objectives but shows some indication that understanding of some important issues is less than complete. Methodological or analytical approaches used are adequate but student has not been thorough or has shown other weaknesses or limitations. |
| B-           | 2.7 points | Borderline  | Weak work for a graduate student; meets the minimal expectations for a graduate student in the course. Understanding of salient issues is somewhat incomplete. Methodological or analytical work performed in the course is minimally adequate. Overall performance, if consistent in graduate courses, would not suffice to sustain graduate status in "good standing."   |
| C+           | 2.3 points | Deficient   | Inadequate work for a graduate student; does not meet the minimal expectations for a graduate student in the course. Work is inadequately developed or flawed by numerous errors and misunderstanding of important issues. Methodological or analytical work performed is weak and fails to demonstrate knowledge or technical competence expected of graduate students.   |
| C            | 2.0 points | "           | "                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| C-           | 1.7 points | "           | "                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| F            | 0.0 points | Fail        | Work fails to meet even minimal expectations for course credit for a graduate student. Performance has been consistently weak in methodology and understanding, with serious limits in many areas. Weaknesses or limits are pervasive.                                                                                                                                     |

## Class Policies

- All submissions must be made from a Jupyter notebook file, following [these instructions](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/assignments.html).

### Attendance

Attending class is mandatory, but most importantly, important. Learning programming requires commitment from the part of the student and the skills are built out of practice. If you miss an experience in class, you miss an important learning moment and the class misses your contribution.

Missing class counts as an absence, regardless of the reason or notifying the instructor(s) beforehand. Missing more than 20 minutes of a class session will be treated as an absence. The first absence is treated as a "freebie", each subsequent absence will result in a 1% deduction from the overall grade.

If you do miss class, we trust that it's for a good reason. If you're sick, please use that freebie and stay home and rest.

You are responsible for getting caught up on what was covered in class. You may want to ask a classmate for notes.

### Sharing

A student may work with other students. However, assignment solutions should not be identical to / copied-and-pasted from one another, and each student should submit theirs separately. In addition, students need to indicate who they worked with with each submission.

Similarly, it is common practice to use code snippets found on the internet; these sources must be cited.

Students are more than welcome to share approaches and code snippets in the Discussions, so long as they aren't giving the full solution away.

Students may post their [Final Project](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/final_project.html) publicly (on GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.) since it's open-ended. Other assignments (with "correct answers") cannot be posted publicly, to avoid cheating in future semesters. You are, however, more than welcome to share any of your notebooks with specific people, such as future employers.

### Generative AI

For this course, generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, etc. are treated the same as other sources. For any code that's copied, reference the use of the tool and link to the discussion (where supported).

Generative AI tools can be incredibly useful, but the code they provide is often incomplete or wrong. Knowing enough about code to critically interpret their results can turn them from a crutch to a superpower.

### SIPA Academic Integrity Statement

The School of International & Public Affairs does not tolerate cheating or plagiarism in any form. Students who violate the Code of Academic & Professional Conduct will be subject to the Dean's Disciplinary Procedures.

Please familiarize yourself with the proper methods of citation and attribution. The School provides some useful resources online; we strongly encourage you to familiarize yourself with these various styles before conducting research. Cut and paste the following link into your browser to view the Code of Academic & Professional Conduct and to access useful resources on citation and attribution: https://bulletin.columbia.edu/sipa/academic-policies/

Violations of the Code of Academic & Professional Conduct should be reported to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs.

### SIPA Disability Statement

SIPA is committed to ensuring that students registered with Columbia University's Disability Services (DS) receive the reasonable accommodations necessary to participate fully in their academic programs. If you are a student with a disability and have a DS-certified accommodation letter, you may wish to make an appointment with your course instructor to discuss your accommodations. Faculty provide disability accommodations to students with DS-certified accommodation letters, and they provide the accommodations specified in such letters. If you have any additional questions, please contact SIPA's DS liaison at disability@sipa.columbia.edu or 212-854-8690.
