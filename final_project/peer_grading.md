# [Final Project](../final_project.md) peer grading

Your Final Project will be reviewed and graded by three of your peers, and you will grade three others'. These will be anonymous. [Scoring details.](../syllabus.md#final-project)

If you disagree with the grade, you can appeal by [emailing the instructor and Reader](../syllabus.md#instructor-information). This comes with a risk: this new grade will be the one that's used, even if it's lower.

## How to review

1. Open [CourseWorks](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/210776).
1. Go to Assignments, then `Final Project`.
   - Each submission should appear as a link to `https://colab.research.google.com/drive/...`.
   - If you're unable to access the notebooks, try:
      - Removing `authuser=<number>` from the URL, if it contains it
      - Accessing in a browser / [incognito window](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464) where you're only signed into your school account, no other Google accounts.
1. Leave substantive feedback as a comment/attachment in the CourseWorks Assignment peer review area.
1. Fill out the rubric.
   - More details in [the analysis requirements](../final_project.md#analysis-requirements).

## Notes for reviewers

- Your feedback should include what they did well, as well as what they could do more clearly/simply/etc.
- The feedback should be constructive; don't be a jerk.
- Points should only be deducted based on the [requirements](../final_project.md#analysis-requirements). Please leave comments beyond that, for things like "this could be done better/differently," even if there isn't a corresponding point deduction.
- You are _not_ expected to run any of their code. The notebook should be graded as-is.
- While there are ways to find who owns a notebook on Colab, please avoid doing so.
- "Changes cannot be saved" doesn't apply to comments.
- [Canvas peer review documentation](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-submit-a-peer-review-to-an-assignment/ta-p/293)
- Reviews are expected to be in-depth, and thus take 15+ minutes each.
- As long as the feedback is thoughtful, you'll receive full points.
