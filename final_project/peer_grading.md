# [Final Project](../final_project.md) peer grading

Your Final Project will be reviewed and graded by three of your peers, and you will grade three others'. These will be anonymous. [Scoring details.](../syllabus.md#final-project)

If you disagree with the grade, you can appeal by [emailing the instructor and grader](../syllabus.md#instructor-information). This comes with a risk: this new grade will be the one that's used, even if it's lower.

## How to review

1. Open [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/432695).
1. Go to `Content`, then `Final Project`. You should see an embedded TurnItIn/PeerMark dashboard.
1. Follow [these instructions to review](https://guides.turnitin.com/hc/en-us/articles/23974126126093-Writing-a-peer-review).
   - Some students have reported issues when using Safari. If you're unable to access, try a different browser.
   - Download the `.html` file and open that file in your browser.
   - PeerMark (annoyingly) doesn't let you edit your review after you submit it, so double-check before submitting.
1. Fill out the rubric.
   - More details in [the analysis requirements](../final_project.md#analysis-requirements).

## Notes for reviewers

- Your feedback should include what they did well, as well as what they could do more clearly/simply/etc.
- The feedback should be constructive; don't be a jerk.
- Points should only be deducted based on the [requirements](../final_project.md#analysis-requirements). Please leave comments beyond that, for things like "this could be done better/differently," even if there isn't a corresponding point deduction.
- You are _not_ expected to run any of their code. The notebook should be graded as-is.
- Reviews are expected to be in-depth, and thus take 15+ minutes each.
- As long as the feedback is thoughtful, you'll receive full points.
