## Getting started

To edit/execute a Homework/lecture notebook:

1. Open the page for the Homework/Lecture on this site.
   - For example: [Homework 0](hw_0.ipynb)
1. Click the launch button (üöÄ) at the top.
   
1. You should now see the notebook in Google Colab.
1. Make sure you're using your Columbia Google account. [How to switch.](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1721977)
1. Click `Copy to Drive`.
That is now your own copy; make edits in there directly.

## Tips

- **Read the instructions carefully.** Like word problems from math class, they are very specific in what they are asking for.
- **Ask for help.**
   - The assignments are meant to be challenging, not impossible.
   - Try and work through problems on your own to start. If you are stuck for more than a half hour, [step away](https://dankim.org/posts/cant-crack-that-programming-problem/). If you _still_ can't figure it out, ask for help.

### Coding in general

- Make variable names descriptive.
   - Do as I say, not as I do!
- Only do one thing per line.
   - Makes troubleshooting easier
- **Spot check your results.** If you are transforming data from a previous Step, compare the results, do a handful of the calculations manually, etc. to ensure that the results are correct.
- **[Don't repeat yourself (DRY).](https://dzone.com/articles/is-your-code-dry-or-wet)** If you find yourself copying and pasting code within your file(s), there's probably a better way to do it.
- **Avoid [hard-coding](https://www.quora.com/What-does-hard-coded-something-mean-in-computer-programming-context) values.** Don't rely on things like row numbers or column order being stable, in case the dataset were to be updated.

### Jupyter / Google Colab

- Keep each cell to only a few lines of code.
   - Allows/encourages you to output intermediate results, ensuring that everything is working as expected.
- You are always welcome to **add cells**. You probably don't want more than a few lines of code in each. This makes the spot checking of intermediate results easier.
- Make notebooks [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence)
    - Makes your work reproducible.
    - Use `Restart and run all` (‚è© button in toolbar).

## Submission

1. Ensure all the outputs are visible and the notebook is cleaned up.
   - This is a good time to run the notebook end-to-end with `Restart and run all`.
   - See [general scoring criteria](syllabus.md#assignment-scoring).
1. Confirm that the notebook is [shared](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html#notebook-storage) with [the instructor and Reader](syllabus.md#instructor-information) with `Commenter` permissions. If it isn't, [share the parent folder](hw_0.ipynb#one-time-setup) and re-confirm.
1. Copy the URL of your notebook.
   - The URL should be of the format `https://colab.research.google.com/drive/<long identifier>`. If it's `https://colab.research.google.com/github/...`, click `Copy to Drive`.
1. Paste your notebook URL in the CourseWorks Assignment.

Engaging with comments left in Google Colab is more than welcome.


### Notes


- In-class exercises will not be submitted/graded.

## Common issues

- **Mounting Google Drive is slow or fails:** See [the Google Colab help page](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html#drive-timeout).
- **Can't load a file from Drive with `requests.get()`:** Use [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files).
  - [How to read a JSON file](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-parse-json-how-to-read-a-json-file/#how-to-parse-and-read-a-json-file-in-python)
- **When using `choropleth_map()`, nothing appears on the map:** Make sure:
  - Your `locations` corresponds to the DataFrame column name and `featureidkey` is set to `properties.<property name>` matching the GeoJSON
    - See [how we found the property name to use](lecture_3.ipynb#geospatial-data)
  - The column and the GeoJSON properties have values that match
- **`SettingWithCopyWarning`:** [How to fix](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/settingwithcopywarning/)
- **`input()` stuck:** Jupyter can be a bit buggy when dealing with interactive input. If it seems to get stuck or you aren't seeing a prompt when you'd expect one, try clicking the `Runtime` menu then `Restart Kernel`.
- **The values are out of order along the axis of a Plotly chart:** Make sure that:
   - The values are integers/floats/[timestamps](https://plotly.com/python/line-charts/#line-plots-on-date-axes), not strings, where applicable.
   - [Line charts: The column used for the X axis is sorted.](https://plotly.com/python/line-charts/#data-order-in-line-charts)
- **`AttributeError: partially initialized module 'orjson' has no attribute 'OPT_NON_STR_KEYS'`:** Add the following cell before your other Plotly code, then `Restart and run all`.

   ```python
   import plotly.io

   plotly.io.json.config.default_engine = 'json'
   ```



### Runtime and memory issues

The runtime is [the place where Python is installed and the code is actually executing](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/stable/projects/kernels.html#kernels), in the cloud somewhere.


- If your runtime is repeatedly crashing, you're probably running out of memory.
  - Make sure you aren't loading data sets you don't need.
  - If loading a new dataset, [make it smaller](assignments/open_ended.md#reducing-data-size)
