    "- Use the [NYC Planning GeoSearch API](https://geosearch.planninglabs.nyc/docs/) for [geocoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_geocoding).\n",
    "- To avoid overwhelming the API, operate on a small subset of the data (no more than thirty addresses that need geocoding).\n",

    "- Try doing single requests to the API from code before trying to run it against a DataFrame.\n",
