# Open-ended assignments

In [Homework 1](../hw_1.md) and the [Final Project](../final_project.md), you will pick your own dataset(s).

- Use at least one dataset that you aren't familiar with.
   - Using data from a primary source is preferred.
- Finding a dataset available in CSV or JSON is recommended, though [pandas can read other formats](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html).
- Note the [JupyterHub limits](../assignments.md#limits).

## Inspiration

For starters, see the [Final Project examples from past semesters](../final_project/examples.md).

Probably not realistic to make visualizations that are as fancy as these ones made by professionals, but they may give you ideas. Some also include links/downloads of the source data.
