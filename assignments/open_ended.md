# Open-ended assignments

In [Homework 1](../hw_1.md), [Homework 4](../hw_4.md), and the [Final Project](../final_project.md), you will pick your own dataset(s). For each:

- Use at least one dataset that you aren't familiar with.
  - Using data from a primary source is preferred.
- It should have between one thousand and one million rows.
  - If it's larger than that, you can [make it smaller](#reducing-data-size).
- Finding a dataset available in CSV or JSON is recommended, though [pandas can read other formats](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html).
- It's ok if you pick the same dataset as another student, as long as you're following [the Academic Integrity rules](../syllabus.md#academic-integrity).

## Inspiration

For starters, see the [Final Project examples from past semesters](../final_project/examples.md).

Probably not realistic to make visualizations that are as fancy as these ones made by professionals, but they may give you ideas. Some also include links/downloads of the source data.

## Storing data

<!-- https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/5663 -->

To work with uploaded files in Google Colab, you have [a lot of options](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb). A few recommended options:

### Direct upload

_Fewer steps, but your file(s) will disappear when your session ends._

<img src="../extras/img/colab_upload_direct.png" height=261 alt="Steps to get data into Google Colab directly"/>

1. In the Google Colab sidebar, click the `Files` icon (A).
1. Click the upload button (B).
1. Select your file.
1. [Read the file in Python.](#reading-files-in-python)

### Google Drive

_More steps, but your file(s) are preserved between sessions._

Expands on the [instructions to mount Google Drive locally](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb#scrollTo=u22w3BFiOveA).

![Steps to get data into Google Colab via Drive](../extras/img/colab_upload_drive.png)

1. Upload the file(s) somewhere in [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive).
1. In the Google Colab sidebar, click the `Files` icon (A).
1. Click the `Mount Drive` icon (B).
   - You may need to run the code it injects to authorize it (C).
   - Think of this as attaching your Drive to your Google Colab instance, as if you were plugging in a USB flash drive.
1. [Read the file in Python.](#reading-files-in-python)

### [InteractiveSheet](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb#scrollTo=BC_eQdDHyCji)

You can [import your data into a Google Sheet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3ic0jqAWJY) and read it directly from Colab.

```python
from google.colab import sheets

sheet_url = "â€¦"
sheet = sheets.InteractiveSheet(url=sheet_url, include_column_headers=True)
df = sheet.as_df()
```

### Reading files in Python

1. Navigate to the file (D).
   - You may need to click into `content`, then `drive`.
1. Next to the filename, click the three dots.
1. Click `Copy path` (E).
   - The value should be something like `/content/drive/My Drive/...`.
1. Use this path with [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/io.html#csv-text-files) (F).

Google Colab cannot access the file on your local machine; in other words, the path shouldn't start with `C:\\` or anything like that. [More info about file paths.](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/file-paths)

## Reducing data size

You can make data smaller _before_ uploading by filtering it through:

- The data portal, if it supports it
  - This makes the download faster, including only the data you need.
  - [Instructions for Socrata-based portals](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/202950808-Creating-a-Filtered-View)
- The `$limit` parameter (or equivalent), if using an API
  - [Socrata documentation](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/limit)
- In a spreadsheet program
