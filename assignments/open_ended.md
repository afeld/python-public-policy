# Open-ended assignments

In [Homework 1](../hw_1.md) and the [Final Project](../final_project.md), you will pick your own dataset(s).

- Use at least one dataset that you aren't familiar with.
   - Using data from a primary source is preferred.
- Finding a dataset available in CSV or JSON is recommended, though [pandas can read other formats](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html).

- If you'd be interested in working with [SIPA alumni employment data](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/pathways-careers/employment-statistics), [reach out to the instructor](../syllabus.md#instructor-information).

## Open data portals

There are countless places to get data, notably:

- Local:
   - [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)
      - [Scout](https://scout.tsdataclinic.com/explore/NYC) can be used to find datasets with certain columns
   - [BetaNYC](https://data.beta.nyc/)
- U.S. Federal:
   - [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
   - [Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/)
   - [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)
- [United Nations](https://data.un.org/)
- [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/)
- [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/data)
- [Economic Policy Institute](https://www.epi.org/data/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
- [Black Wealth Data](https://blackwealthdata.org/)
- [DataHub](https://datahub.io/collections)
- Lists of open data portals:
   - [DataPortals](https://dataportals.org/)
   - [Open Data Network](https://www.opendatanetwork.com/)

## Inspiration

For starters, see the [Final Project examples from past semesters](../final_project/examples.md).

Probably not realistic to make visualizations that are as fancy as these ones made by professionals, but they may give you ideas. Some also include links/downloads of the source data.

- [Climate & Economic Justice Screening Tool](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/)
- [FiveThirtyEight Interactives](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/)
- [The Guardian Visual Journalism](https://www.theguardian.com/interactive)
- [New York Times Graphics](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/graphics)
- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)
- [ProPublica News Apps](https://www.propublica.org/newsapps/)
- [Statista]({{statista_url}})
- [Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/)

## Storing data

{% if id == "columbia" -%}
To keep data between sessions, you'll probably want to store it in Google Drive.

1. Upload the file(s) somewhere in Drive.
1. In the Colab sidebar, click the `Files` icon.
1. Click the `Mount Drive` icon.
   - Think of this as attaching your Drive to your Colab instance, as if you were plugging in a USB flash drive.
1. Navigate to the file.
1. Next to the filename, click the three dots.
1. Click `Copy path`.
   - The value should be something like `/content/drive/My Drive/...`.
1. Use this path with `read_csv()`.
{% else -%}
1. Open the [{{coding_env_name}} file browser]({{coding_env_url}}).
1. Navigate to the folder your notebook is in.
1. [Upload the data.](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/howto/content/add-data.html#adding-data-from-your-local-machine)
1. From Python, use `read_csv("./<filename>.csv")`.

Note that that file path should be to relative to the notebook within {{coding_env_name}} â€” `./` means "in the same directory". {{coding_env_name}} cannot access the file on your local machine; in other words, the path shouldn't start with `C:\\` or anything like that. [More info about file paths](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/file-paths)

## Limits

{{coding_env_name}} has a disk storage limit of 1GB (a.k.a. 1,024 MB or 1,048,576 KB) across all your files, and a memory limit of 3GB.

## Reducing data size

You can make data smaller _before_ uploading by filtering it through:

- The data portal, if it supports it
  - This makes the download faster, including only the data you need.
  - [Instructions for Socrata-based portals](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/202950808-Creating-a-Filtered-View)
- In a spreadsheet program
