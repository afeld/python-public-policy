# Submission [Architecture Decision Record (ADR)](https://18f.gsa.gov/2021/07/06/architecture_decision_records_helpful_now_invaluable_later/)

Status: **DRAFT**

12/1/24

## Context

Students are currently [directed to export PDFs and submit via {{lms_name}}](../../assignments.md#submission). This has various tradeoffs â€” see the comparison below. I think there might be a better way.

### Considerations

- The assignments are largely/increasingly open-ended.
- There's more need for manual line-by-line feedback.

### Nice-to-haves

- Auto-grading
- Minimal/foolproof [submission steps](../../assignments.md#submission)

## Options

### Format

| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **PDF**      | Avoids "works on my machine"                                                                                                 | No support for interactive plots; [Plotly needs extra packages][kaleido] and is [fragile][fragile]; long/wide outputs look bad |
| **HTML**     | Supports interactive plots; outputs support scrolling, though that must be done by the student; avoids "works on my machine" | [Plotly rendering broken in v6.0.0][html-render]                                                                               |
| **Notebook** | Supports interactive plots; long outputs are collapsable/scrollable by the {{assistant_name}}                                |                                                                                                                                |

### PDF export

If sticking with PDFs, they can be exported from {{coding_env_name}}:

| **As HTML, then Save as PDF**            | [Higher fidelity][fidelity] | Extra steps; Plotly doesn't re-draw on print, so need to resize window or set dimensions to ensure it fits |
