# Submission [Architecture Decision Record (ADR)](https://18f.gsa.gov/2021/07/06/architecture_decision_records_helpful_now_invaluable_later/)

Status: **DRAFT**

12/1/24

## Context

Students are currently [directed to export PDFs and submit via {{lms_name}}](../../assignments.md#submission). This has various tradeoffs â€” see the comparison below. I think there might be a better way.

### Considerations

- The assignments are largely/increasingly open-ended.
- There's more need for manual line-by-line feedback.

### Nice-to-haves

- Auto-grading
- Minimal/foolproof [submission steps](../../assignments.md#submission)

### PDF export

If sticking with PDFs, they can be exported from {{coding_env_name}}:
