# Submission [Architecture Decision Record (ADR)](https://18f.gsa.gov/2021/07/06/architecture_decision_records_helpful_now_invaluable_later/)

Status: **DRAFT**

12/1/24

## Context

Students are currently [directed to export PDFs and submit via {{lms_name}}](../../assignments.md#submission). This has various tradeoffs â€” see the comparison below. I think there might be a better way.

### Considerations

- The assignments are largely/increasingly open-ended.
- There's more need for manual line-by-line feedback than auto-grading.

### Nice-to-haves

- Auto-grading
- Plagiarism detection
- Minimal/foolproof workflows for:
  - [Submission](../../assignments.md#submission)
  - [Grading](../assistant_guide.md#grading)

## Options

| Option       | Tool                             | Autograder support | Plagiarism detection | Inline annotation                    | Notebooks are interactive\*                        | Integration with {{lms_name}} | Other pros                                                               | Other cons                                                                                                |

### PDF export

If sticking with PDFs, they can be exported from {{coding_env_name}}:
